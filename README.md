## Introduction

Factor models are statistical models that explain asset returns based on their exposure to various risk factors. This project provides a framework to:
- Explore common financial factors (e.g., Value, Momentum, Size, Quality).
- Construct and analyze multi-factor portfolios.
- Backtest factor-based strategies.
- Visualize factor performance and contributions.

## Features

- **Data Loading & Preprocessing:** Tools for ingesting historical stock data and preparing it for factor analysis.
- **Factor Calculation:** Implementations for calculating common and custom financial factors.
- **Portfolio Construction:** Methods for building factor-based portfolios (e.g., long-short, long-only).
- **Performance Attribution:** Analyze the contribution of individual factors to portfolio returns.
- **Backtesting Framework:** Evaluate strategy performance over historical periods.
- **Visualization:** Plot factor exposures, portfolio returns, and performance metrics.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Xyxl1kalgo/Factor-Model-Analysis.git](https://github.com/Xyxl1kalgo/Factor-Model-Analysis.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Factor-Model-Analysis
    ```
3.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
4.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note: If `requirements.txt` is not present, you might need to create it first with packages like `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `jupyter`, `yfinance` (if using Yahoo Finance data).*
